<h1>The Best Movies According to Gulnara</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2> <hr />
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>One of my favourite movies of all time that got it all: good script, characters, story, philosophy, actors and music. and the setting is space, planets and all. How cool is that?</p>
<h3>Bruges</h3>
<p>Everything above minus space plus Collin Farrell.</p>
<h3>Amadeus</h3>
<p>This movie is one of a kind, don't think you ever watched anything like that.</p>
